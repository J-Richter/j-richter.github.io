<h1>Currency and Money Amount</h1>
<p>
This document registers tags for serializing a currency and a money amount in Concise Binary
Object Representation (CBOR) (ref. 1).
</p>
<h3>Currency</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   tbd9
<li>Data item: text string or positive integer
<li>Semantics: ISO 4217 currency
</ul>
<h3>Amount of Money</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   tbd10
<li>Data item: array
<li>Semantics: Combines a number with a currency to represent a money amount
</ul>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
  Financial software has the requirement to store and transmit currencies and amounts of money.

  In order to encode and decode this data semantically using CBOR, it is necessary to tag this values.  This
  document proposes two new tags for a single currency and for a combination of a number and a currency.
</p><p>
  Almost every software that processes monetary amounts of different currency has its own types to store
  these values. To ensure interoperality with CBOR, it is necessary to tag the values semantically.
</p><p>
<h2>
Detailed Semantics
</h2>
<p>
  A currency in CBOR has tag tbd9 and is encoded as a text string or a positive integer.
  The text string is the ISO 4217 currency code.  The integer is the ISO 4217 currency number.
</p><p>
  A money amount in CBOR has tag tbd10 and is encoded as an array of length 2.  The first element of the
  array is the numeric value of the money amount.  The second element is the currency encoded as a text
  string or a positive integer with the same semantics as above.

  The numeric value can be a positive integer (major type 0), a negative integer (major type 1),
  a positive bignum (tag 2), a negative bignum (tag 3), a decimal fraction (tag 4), a bigfloat (tag 5) or
  a rational number (tag 30).
  Implementations must support positive integers, negative integers and decimal fractions.  Support for
  bignums, bigfloats and rational numbers is optional.

</p><p>
  A CBOR decoder can treat data items with tag tbd9 or tbd10 that don't meet the criteria above as an
  error, but this specification doesn't define how a CBOR implementation ought to behave in this case.
  Section 3.4 of RFC 7049 (ref. 1) details this kind of error-handling behavior.
</p><p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
The following example shows how the currency "USD" is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
  c9           -- tag(9)
     63        -- text(3)
	555344 -- "USD"
</pre>

<p>
The following example shows how the money amount "85 EUR"  is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
  ca              -- tag(10)
     82           -- array(2)
	18 55     -- unsigned(85)
	63        -- text(3)
	   455552 -- "EUR"
</pre>

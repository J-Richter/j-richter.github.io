<h1>Date, Time and Time Zone</h1>
<p>
This document registers tags for serializing date, time of day and a time zone designator in Concise Binary
Object Representation (CBOR) (ref. 1).
</p>
<h3>Date</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   tbd6
<li>Data item: positive or negative integer or text string
<li>Semantics: Date / Days since 1970-01-01
</ul>
<h3>Time</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   tbd7
<li>Data item: positive integer or floating point number or text string
<li>Semantics: Time of day / Seconds since midnight (00:00)
</ul>
<h3>Time Zone</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tag:   tbd8
<li>Data item: text string
<li>Semantics: IANA Time Zone designator
</ul>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
  Many areas of daily life require date and time information. For example, birthdays or opening hours.
  CBOR tag 1 provides only a coding for time points.  A major disadvantage is that a specific date or time can
  only be interpreted in conjunction with a time zone or a UTC offset.  This document
  proposes two new tags so that the date and time can be encoded individually.
</p><p>
  A date consists of three components: year, month and day.
</p><p>
  A time consists of 2 to 4 components. Hour, minute, optional second, optional fractional second.
</p><p>
  In addition, a tag is specified for the coding of a IANA time zone designator.
</p><p>
  Some programming languages have built-in support for date, time or time zone objects.  C++ has a proposal to
  add support to its standard library. (As of 2019)
</p><p>
<h2>
Detailed Semantics
</h2>
<p>
  A date in CBOR has tag tbd6 and is encoded as a positive or negative integer or a text string.
  The integer counts the days since 1970-01-01.  The text string encodes the date in ISO 8601 format
  "YYYY-MM-DD".
</p><p>
  A time of day in CBOR has tag tbd7 and is encoded as a positive integer or a floating point number or a text
  string.  The integer and floating point number encode the (fractional) seconds since midnight.  The text
  string encodes the time in ISO 8601 format "hh:mm", "hh:mm:ss" or "hh:mm:ss.sss".  The last one contains
  fractional seconds "sss".  Fractional seconds have at least 1 decimal place and are not limited to any
  length.
</p><p>
  A time zone has the tag tbd8 and is encoded as a text string.
</p><p>
  A CBOR decoder can treat data items with tag tbd6, tbd7 or tbd8 that don't meet the criteria above as an
  error, but this specification doesn't define how a CBOR implementation ought to behave in this case.
  Section 3.4 of RFC 7049 (ref. 1) details this kind of error-handling behavior.
</p><p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
The following example shows how the date 2018-12-31 is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
  c6         -- tag(6)
     19 45e8 -- unsigned(17896)
</pre>

<p>
The following example shows how the time 12:00:05 is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
  c7         -- tag(7)
     19 a8c5 -- unsigned(43205)
</pre>

<p>
The following example shows how the time zone "America/New_York" is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
  c8                                     -- tag(8)
     70                                  -- text(16)
       416d65726963612f4e65775f596f726b  -- "America/New_York"
</pre>
